# TODO

[ ] Accept images in new run input
[ ] Move default model option of new run modal to be first in new run input
[ ] instead of one hotkey per model type or workflow type in the new run modal, just have a hotkey for workflows and a hotkey for models. each otkey will cycle through all available options
[ ] add a decorative loading spinner next to the agtop name just to reasure the user that the app is running and updating live. also add one to the bottom of the logs file while the run is going, maybe a dancing elipsis or something. also add a loading indicator to the run in the run panel if it's active. Basically add an indicator anytime we're still waiting for input or responses or stuff is still happening.
[ ] pressing enter on a run in the runs panel should show a dropdown list of all concurrent runs happening or just one if one is the only run
[?] add ability to update (provide follow-on prompts) a run after it's completed
