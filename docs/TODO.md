# TODO

[ ] pressing enter on a run in the runs panel should show a dropdown list of all concurrent runs happening or just one if one is the only run
[ ] Convert skills to output in json for easier reading by LLMs. Could also allow for things like the spec skill to specify if this should be broken down into multiple tasks and allow skipping the deconstruct skill and go straight to a parallel workflow?
